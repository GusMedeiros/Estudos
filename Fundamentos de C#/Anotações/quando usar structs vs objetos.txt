https://stackoverflow.com/questions/85553/when-should-i-use-a-struct-instead-of-a-class

Bill Wagner has a chapter about this in his book "effective c#" 
(http://www.amazon.com/Effective-Specific-Ways-Improve-Your/dp/0321245660). 
He concludes by using the following principle:

1. Is the main responsability of the type data storage?
2. Is its public interface defined entirely by properties that access or modify its data members?
3. Are you sure your type will never have subclasses?
4. Are you sure your type will never be treated polymorphically?
If you answer 'yes' to all 4 questions: use a struct. Otherwise, use a class.
